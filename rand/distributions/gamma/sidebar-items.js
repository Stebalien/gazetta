For other `k`, this uses the equivalent characterisation `χ²(k) = Gamma(k/2, 2)`.Example"],["FisherF","The Fisher F distribution `F(m, n)`.This distribution is equivalent to the ratio of two normalised chi-squared distributions, that is, `F(m,n) = (χ²(m)/m) / (χ²(n)/n)`.Example"],["Gamma","The Gamma distribution `Gamma(shape, scale)` distribution.The density function of this distribution iswhere `Γ` is the Gamma function, `k` is the shape and `θ` is the scale and both `k` and `θ` are strictly positive.The algorithm used is that described by Marsaglia & Tsang 2000[1], falling back to directly sampling from an Exponential for `shape == 1`, and using the boosting technique described in [1] for `shape < 1`.Example[1]: George Marsaglia and Wai Wan Tsang. 2000. \"A Simple Method for Generating Gamma Variables\" *ACM Trans.

initSidebarItems({"fn":[["parse","Tries to parse given string into `parsed` with given formatting items. Returns `Ok` when the entire string has been parsed (otherwise `parsed` should not be used). There should be no trailing string after parsing; use a stray `Item::Space` to trim whitespaces.This particular date and time parser is:Greedy. It will consume the longest possible prefix. For example, `April` is always consumed entirely when the long month name is requested; it equally accepts `Apr`, but prefers the longer prefix in this case. Padding-agnostic (for numeric items). The `Pad` field is completely ignored, so one can prepend any number of whitespace then any number of zeroes before numbers. (Still) obeying the intrinsic parsing width. This allows, for example, parsing `HHMMSS`."]]});
